# Next.js CRUD Tutorial

## Project Overview

Welcome to an educational project designed to teach full-stack development with a focus on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This repository holds a Next.js application implemented with TypeScript, styled with Material UI, and backed by a MySQL database. We utilize Prisma as our ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, and Cloudinary for handling product images.

## Learn CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Add new products.
- **Read**: Display products.
- **Update**: Modify existing products.
- **Delete**: Remove products.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Folder for source code of the application.
- `app/`: Houses the main application logic, including API routing and pages.
- `components/`: Contains reusable React components used across different parts of the application.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for various parts of your application, such as settings.
- `db/`: Contains database connection handlers.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions or helper functions used across the application.
- `types/`: Holds TypeScript type definitions for application, enhancing type safety and code maintainability.
- `actions/`: Contains action functions responsible for triggering specific actions within your application such as API requests.
- `prisma/`: Contains Prisma-related files such as schema definitions and migrations.
- `public/`: Contains static assets like images, fonts, or other files that need to be publicly accessible. These assets are typically served directly by the server without any processing.
